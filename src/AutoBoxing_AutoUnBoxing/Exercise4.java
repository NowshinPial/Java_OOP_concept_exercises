package AutoBoxing_AutoUnBoxing;

/**
 * Task: Write a program to demonstrate how autoboxing and auto-unboxing behave in conditional statements.
 *
 * 1. Create an Integer object num and assign it a value (e.g., 100).
 * 2. Write an if statement to check whether num is greater than 50.
 * 3. Print "Number is large" if the condition is true; otherwise, print "Number is small."
 * 4. Add a case where num is null and handle the possible exception.
 *
 * Expected Behavior:
 * When num is non-null, it will automatically unbox to a primitive for the comparison.
 * If num is null, it should throw a NullPointerException during unboxing.
