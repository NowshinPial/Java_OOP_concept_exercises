package AutoBoxing_AutoUnBoxing;

/**
 * Task: Write a program that performs mathematical operations on wrapper classes, demonstrating auto-unboxing.
 *
 * 1. Create two Integer objects, num1 and num2, and assign them values (e.g., 20 and 30).
 * 2. Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division directly using these objects (e.g., int sum = num1 + num2;).
 * 3. Print the results of each operation.
 *
 * Expected Behavior:
 * The Integer objects should be automatically unboxed to int values during the operations, and the result should be stored as a primitive.
