package AutoBoxing_AutoUnBoxing;

/**
 * Task: Write a program that creates methods for both primitive and wrapper types and demonstrates autoboxing and auto-unboxing during method calls.
 *
 * 1. Create a class with the following methods:
 *      - void processInt(int x) — prints "Processing int: " followed by the value.
 *      - void processInteger(Integer x) — prints "Processing Integer: " followed by the value.
 * 2. In the main method:
 *      - Call processInt with an Integer object and observe auto-unboxing.
 *      - Call processInteger with a primitive int and observe autoboxing.
 * 3. Add a processNumber(Number x) method to handle both int and Integer through polymorphism.
 * 4. Call the methods and print the results.
 *
 * Expected Behavior:
 * The compiler will handle the necessary conversions (autoboxing or auto-unboxing) based on the method signatures.
