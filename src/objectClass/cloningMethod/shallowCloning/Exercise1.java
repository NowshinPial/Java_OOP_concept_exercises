/**
 * Clone a Simple Class with Primitive and Object Fields
 *
 * 1. Create a Person class with the following fields:
 *      - name (String)
 *      - age (int)
 *      - address (an object of an Address class that has street and city as its fields)
 * 2. Implement shallow cloning for the Person class.
 * 3. Create an instance of Person, clone it, and modify the address of the cloned object.
 * 4. Observe how changes in the cloned objectâ€™s address affect the original object.
