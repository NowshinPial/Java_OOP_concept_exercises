/**
*Exercise 7: Cannot Instantiate an Interface
Objective: Learn that you cannot create an object of an interface.

1. Try to create an object of an interface Device like this:
	- Device device = new Device(); The compiler should show an error because you cannot instantiate an interface directly.

/*interface Device {
	
}

class Remote{
	
	Device device = new Device(); //compiler error, can not instantiate an interface.
